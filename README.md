### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Michael McGrath, I am Lambda School alumni, currently working as a team lead at Lambda School for the iOS program. My interests are coding, video editing, playing video games, and all things tech related. A San Francisco, Bay Area native.

I am an enthusiastic technologist who is studying iOS development and specializing in Swift and Objective-C programming languages. As an avid Apple fan, I am interested in using their latest technology to build useful and visually exciting apps that help improve a users daily life. I am always eager to learn new skills and languages to improve the apps I'm working on and to grow my existing iOS developer skill set. 

I am looking for new opportunities in iOS development with a company that values making apps that are user friendly, and that help improve the users life in some way. I take ownership of my projects and tasks and am looking to work at a company that empowers developers to own their areas of responsibility. As a leader at Lambda, I get to share my skills with our students and am interested in a role where I can learn and grow as well as share my knowledge with a team.
